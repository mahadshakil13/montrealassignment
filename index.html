		<h3>Welcome to Little France, Montreal</h3>
		
		<p id = "about"> Montreal is the second most populated city in Canada, and is located in the Provice of Quebec. It has a long and rich history with France reaching back to the 16th century.
		French Canadians are the majority in Montreal, which is why it is referred to as Little France. I do not know any French despite being born from there, buit I plan on learning french
		when I get the chance. Montreal is the biggest host of international events in North America, and is home to the Cirque de Soleil, the largest contemporary circus in the world! Montreal has so many other
		amazing attractions to see and things to do!		</p>
